## 5. **Dante**
Dante from Devil May Cry is everything that makes a character memorable. He's cool, funny, has an iconic design, and his gameplay rocks.
Playing as Dante, the player feels everybit as cool as the Demon hunter, with his variety of weapons changing between games, Each new one feels like a pool that you keep dipping your toes in. Stylish, Complex, and Awesome. Dante is my number 5.
